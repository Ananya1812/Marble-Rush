I have always had a thing for candy, loving its sweet taste. That love led me to get super into Candy Crush, spending a ton of time solving its tricky puzzles. i got really interested in how the game worked, so i decided to make my own version using marbles. That's how Marble Rush came to existenceâ€”a cool game that mixes my love for candy with the puzzle fun of Candy Crush, but instead of tapping a screen, me play with colorful marbles.


Creating Marble Rush took a ton of work! I put in a lot of effort to code and debug it. Learning how to build the game was pretty challenging, but also super interesting. I had to dive into various JavaScript codes, figuring out how they all fit together to make the game work. It was a learning curve for sure, but getting through it was an awesome experience!
